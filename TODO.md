# New Features

This document keeps a (relatively) prioritized list of features we want.

## Documentation

* examples of how to make workflows in CWL that bring together individual tools, and to scale up analysis using cloud orchestration systems like [Consonance](https://github.com/Consonance/)

## UI

* allow users to register CWL and Docker image tar files with simple URLs in addition to the current Quay.io-based system
* support DockerHub as a location for hosting Dockstore images
* support BitBucket and other Git repositories for Dockerfiles and Dockstore.cwl
* support for community tagging and star ratings for tools
* support for better browsing of tools on the site, think faceted browser like the [ICGC DCC Portal](https://dcc.icgc.org), using the tags mentioned in the previous bullet
* CWL workflow registration in addition to individual tools
* support for private repositories, groups, sharing settings, etc
* unique, stable URL for each tool/version that can be used in publications
