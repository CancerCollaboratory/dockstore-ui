# About Dockstore

The Dockstore concept is simple, provide a place where users can share tools
encapsulated in Docker and described with the [GA4GH](http://genomicsandhealth.org/)
[Common Workflow Language](http://common-workflow-language.github.io/) (CWL).
This enables scientists, for example, to share analytical tools in a way that makes them
machine readable and runnable in a variety of environments.

# Built with Quay.io and Github

Docker repositories, like
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) and [Quay.io](https://quay.io/), and
source control repositories like [GitHub](http://github.com) and
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), provide
much of the infrastructure we need.  They allow users build, publish,
and share both public and private Docker images.  However, the services lack a standardized ways of
describing how to invoke tools contained within the Docker containers.  The CWL
standard has defined a way to define the inputs, parameterizations, and outputs
of tools using a YAML-formated file.  Together, these resources provide the
necessary tools to share analytical tools in a highly portable way, a key
concern for the scientific community.
