## July 9, 2016 - ISMB Tutorial

As described at [ISMB](http://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismb2016/akes.php)

> Dr. O’Connor will begin by discussing the ICGC PCAWG project and the insights he's gained from rapidly analyzing thousands of whole cancer genomes. Attendees will learn about how his team has used Docker as a key component to their workflow, best practices for creating shareable tools, as well as the motivation behind the creation of Dockstore (dockstore.org), a platform for sharing Docker­based tools described with the Common Workflow Language. Attendees will learn how to create custom Docker containers and push them to Dockstore to share with the community.

## November 18, 2015 - First Workflow from the PCAWG Project released
 
ICGC on the cloud goes live and is described on the AWS Blog at [New AWS Public Data Sets – TCGA and ICGC](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-data-sets-tcga-and-icgc/) and can be visualized at [ICGC on the Amazon Cloud](https://dcc.icgc.org/icgc-in-the-cloud/aws)

The first workflow used to generate this dataset, BWA, is posted on Dockstore as a [CWL tool](https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/pancancer/pcawg-bwa-mem-workflow).
