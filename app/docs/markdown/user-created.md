# User Created Projects

Of course, the Dockstore team is not the only ones that write code or documentation to work with CWL tools and Dockstore. Here we list some user-created projects that make it easier to work with Dockstore in various ways.  

## [cgp-dockstore](https://github.com/cancerit/cgp-dockstore)

Out of the Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust, Sanger Institute, this project makes it easier for users that are familiar with [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to work with tools and images registered on Dockstore on OpenStack. 

## [PCAWG-Docker-Test](https://github.com/mikisvaz/PCAWG-Docker-Test)

Miguel Vazquez has been leading the docktesters group. This is a group that is in charge of testing the [PCAWG](http://icgc.org/working-pancancer-data-aws)(PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes) tools and workflows. As a part of this work he created a series of scripts (linked above) that demonstrate how to get data and run through all of the PCAWG analysis in sequence.  

## [Alignment pipeline tutorial for the Pan Prostate project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djQ-8YlqfjbOJRnkeCu7lV1he_vJygIXn4ExHz6m874/edit?usp=sharing)

Tutorials and documentation are always appreciated as well!
The following tutorial demonstrates how to run the Pan Prostate pipeline and how to work with Dockstore tools (normally using Docker images) using Singularity.
