        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>The goal for the Dockstore is to bring together tools in Docker containers with a standardized, programmatic
          method of describing how to call them.
          Coupled with registration at Dockstore, this process makes it much easier to use Docker-based tools to build
          larger analytical systems.</p>


        <p>A typical use case for the sciences is to create complex workflows with multiple tools to process large
          datasets.
          We also provide functionality to register, display, and share workflows.</p>

        <p>If you are new to Dockstore, please continue to read.</p>
